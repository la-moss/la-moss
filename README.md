# Lee Moss
**Cloud & Infrastructure Engineer | Weekly Incident Labs**

> **AI writes the tickets; you fix the infrastructure.**
> 
> Learn cloud & infra by solving *real incidents* — not tutorials. Every Monday, a custom GPT generates a production-style ticket. You clone the repo, fix the issue, then compare your approach with my write-up and guardrails.

**Focus: Azure • Terraform • Networking • Incident Response**

## 🎯 What This Is

Weekly **incident labs** designed to build real cloud engineering instincts:

- **AI-powered tickets**: A custom GPT generates 3-level incident scenarios (Rookie / Mid / Senior)
- **No hand-holding**: You get a broken Azure/Terraform setup. Fix it. Learn the *why*.
- **Guardrails, not answers**: My write-ups include IaC patterns, networking logic, and CI policies — not full solutions
- **Real-world skills**: Networking, IAM, disaster recovery, cost optimization, policy as code

---

## 🚀 Start Here

- **[Ticket #001 — Hub–Spoke "Ghost" Routing](./tickets/001)** • UDRs, peering, asymmetry
- **[Ticket #002 — Azure Firewall DNAT Drift](./tickets/002)** • Idempotent DNAT, CI guardrails, drift detection *(10th November)*
- **[All Tickets](./tickets)** • Browse by level and topic

## 📅 Weekly Rhythm

| Day | What Drops | Why It Helps |
|---|---|---|
| **Mon** | New ticket (3 levels) | Clear scope for the week |
| **Wed** | Office hours (no solutions) | Ask 1 clarifying Q with evidence |
| **Thu** | Community spotlight | Celebrate diagrams, PRs, guardrails |
| **Mon (next)** | 3-bullet postmortem + new ticket | Close the loop & level up |

## 🤝 How to Participate

1. **Pick your level** in the ticket repo (Rookie / Mid / Senior)
2. **Work the problem** — share steps, screenshots, logs, HCL diffs
3. **Submit** via the repo's *Submission* issue template or open a PR if you improved modules/tests

> **House rules**: Be respectful. Redact secrets. Don't post full solutions.
