# Lee Moss
**Cloud & Infrastructure Engineer | Weekly Incident Labs**

> **AI writes the tickets; we fix the infrastructure.**
> 
> Learn cloud & infra by solving *real incidents* — not tutorials. Every Monday, a custom GPT generates a production-style ticket. You clone the repo, fix the issue, then compare your approach with my write-up and guardrails.

**Focus: Azure • Terraform • Networking • Incident Response**

## 🎯 What This Is

Weekly **incident labs** designed to build real cloud engineering instincts:

- **AI-powered tickets**: A custom GPT generates a production style ticket and repo (Rookie / Mid / Senior)
- **Guardrails, not answers**: My write-ups include IaC patterns, networking logic, and CI policies
- **Real-world skills**: Networking, IAM, disaster recovery, cost optimisation, policy as code

---

## 🤝 How to Participate

1. **Pick your level** in the ticket repo (Rookie / Mid / Senior)
2. **Work the problem** — share steps, screenshots, logs, HCL diffs

> **House rules**: Be respectful. Redact secrets. Don't post full solutions.
