# Lee Moss — Azure/Terraform Incident Labs

Azure Infrastructure Engineer at UK Home Office | IaC & DevOps

I publish **repo-based incident labs** so you can build real debugging instincts by fixing realistic Azure/Terraform failures

**Weekly loop:**  
Production-style ticket → broken repo → you clone/deploy/investigate → you ship a fix → compare with my walkthrough.
