# Lee Moss — Azure/Terraform Incident Labs

I publish **repo-based incident labs** so you can build real debugging instincts by fixing realistic Azure/Terraform failures — not reading tutorials.

**Weekly loop:** ticket → broken repo → you investigate → you ship a fix → you compare with my walkthrough.
